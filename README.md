# FAKE RCON

Fake RCON allows you to execute RCON commands with a login, it's time for valve to fix their in-game problem

This is only available for Windows.

To configure the rcon, you must create an rcon.txt file in the /game/bin/{OS} folder, where is your CS game binary.

The password must be at least 4 characters long. We use a file because convar management is not yet complete on the cs2 SDK
